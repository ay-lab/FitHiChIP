Utilities of FitHiChIP at a glance
------------------------------------

	- FitHiChIP derives the statistically significant CIS interactions from a given **HiChIP / PLAC-seq**, and now for **Hi-C** data as well.
		- CIS Interactions within a specified distance range (default = 20 Kb to 2 Mb: can be user defined) and for a specified fixed size bin size, are computed. 
		- Distance decay model proposed in the method FitHiC (Ay and Noble, Genome Research  2014) together with a novel bias (coverage / ICE) regression model is used to find the statistical significant interactions.
	
	- Processing HiChIP / PLAC-seq requires specifying ChIP-seq peaks corresponding to the target protein or histone modifications of interest. 
		- Either user can provide ChIP-seq peak files from ENCODE, ROADMAP, or any other reference. 
		- Alternatively, **FitHiChIP supports calling peaks from HiChIP data**, which can be used to find out the interactions involving peaks (enriched) segments.
	
	- FitHiChIP also supports finding **differential HiChIP contacts** between two different categories of HiChIP data, having one or more replicates.

	- FitHiChIP also proposes a basic implementation of **simulating HiChIP contact map given a reference HiC contact map and a ChIP-seq alignment file**, with respect to specified number of reads. (**Note**: this implementation is still in basic stage; output HiChIP heatmap shows explicit bias towards low range contacts.)
